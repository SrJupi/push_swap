# 42 Project - push_swap

## Subject
### Summary
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

### Introduction
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.</br>
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.</br>
Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

### Rules
You have 2 stacks named a and b.</br>
At the beginning:</br>
The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.</br>
The stack b is empty.</br>
The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal:</br>
<li>sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.</br>
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</li>
<li>sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.</br>
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</li>
<li>ss : sa and sb at the same time.</li>
<li>pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.</br>
Do nothing if b is empty.</li>
<li>pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.</br>
Do nothing if a is empty.</li>
<li>ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.</br>
The first element becomes the last one.</li>
<li>rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.</br>
The first element becomes the last one.</li>
<li>rr : ra and rb at the same time.</li>
<li>rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.</br>
The last element becomes the first one.</li>
<li>rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.</br>
The last element becomes the first one.</li>
<li>rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.</li>
